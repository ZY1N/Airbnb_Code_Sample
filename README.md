# Airbnb_Code_Sample

This is my code sample for Airbnb. I had a few days to put together a protocol to collect samples from petri dishes. For that I had to learn python, opentrons library, and spirals.
Although it is messy I was able to pull through and finish it within the deadline using unfamiliar concepts and tools. My highlight is the main function that does the work, although in hindsight I could have abstracted better.
